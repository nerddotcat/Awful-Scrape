## Awful Scrape
This python script is meant to rip links to images from threads on somethingawful.com.
The reason I made this script was to have an easier way to view images in the YOSPOS cat picture thread.
Currently, the thread is getting close to 5000 pages and I'm approximating that there are about 10-20 pictures per page. Which means lots of cat pics.
The script saves links to images to a json format file so you can do whatever with the links.
I currently have a simple html page that displays some pictures.
